                <p class="text-center pt-2">We are looking for families to feature in our studio samples, and we want to
                    give back to the families that agree to this limited time offer.<br><br>

                    When families decide to invest in a professional photography session, they are typically investing
                    somewhere between $1,500-$2,000. This includes their session fee, digital photos, prints, and
                    more.<br><br>

                    Our session fee is a flat $300, and any digital files or prints are purchased separately. With this
                    special, you’re getting the session fee waived and up to $200 in credit that can be used on any
                    studio purchase.<br><br>

                    Investments like this last a lifetime, and an opportunity to get a professional photo experience
                    like this is something you won’t want to pass up.<br><br>

                    with your kids. We spend the first portion of your session taking fun photos, laughing, and making
                    sure everyone is having a great time. Once all the pictures are taken, we invite you to relax in our
                    studio while we work hard behind the scenes to get your photos edited and ready for you to
                    see.<br><br>

                    Yep- you’ll get to see your amazing photos before you even leave our studio that day!
                    From there, you can decide what you would like to use your gift vouchers on, and then your session
                    is complete!<br>

                </h5>

                <p class="text-center pt-2">“The photos Ranjani took of my wife and I are our favorites. I ordinarily
                    don't like being in front of the camera, but the shoot felt natural and fun. The pictures she got
                    are full of personality and find a way to tell a story in a single frame. Highly recommend.” -
                    Greg<br><br>


                    “Ranjani is not only a skilled photographer, but a really kind and thoughtful individual. Trusting
                    her with photo sessions for my growing family feels like such an investment because I know the
                    photos will feel truly authentic. I highly recommend her studios!” - Kristiane<br><br>


                    “Ranjani is fantastic! She has taken photos of our family several times over the past few years and
                    they are always amazing. She is able to capture the emotions, personalities, and love so
                    beautifully. I always know I will be thrilled with the photos when we have Ranjani take our
                    pictures.” - Laura<br><br>


                    “Ranjani has done several family photo sessions for my extended family, maternity photos and a
                    family photo shoot with my 2 year old and 2 month old and let me tell you...she’s a rock star. The
                    photo shoots are fun and relaxing because I trust her completely to get amazing shots. I feel like
                    we can just be ourselves and she is going to capture that for us. HIGHLY recommend!!” -

                <h5 class="colorDeepGreen text-center pt-3">Is this a competition?
                </h5>
                <p class="text-center">Nope! We want to fill our studio with photo samples of real people. You don’t
                    have to be a model to
                    qualify, either. We want to see real smiles and real connections between moms and their kids in our
                    photos.</p><br>

                <h5 class="colorDeepGreen text-center pt-3">What will I get?
                </h5>
                <p class="text-center">You get a complimentary professional photography session, valued at $300, plus a
                    $100 gift voucher just for signing up, and another $100 gift voucher for keeping your original
                    session date and time, for a total value of $500!</p><br>

                <h5 class="colorDeepGreen text-center pt-3">Can I bring family members too?
                </h5>
                <p class="text-center">Of course! We are happy to accommodate siblings, parents, grandparents, fur
                    babies, and anyone you would want to be photographed with!</p><br>

                </h5>
                <p class="text-center">Absolutely! We want you to have photo evidence of your amazingly fun photo
                    session! You can use your gift voucher and retainer fee towards the purchase of prints, products,
                    wall art, and digital files. </p><br>


                <h5 class="colorDeepGreen text-center pt-3">Why is there a retainer fee for a free photo session?
                </h5>
                <p class="text-center">Good question- We put a lot of time and effort into planning each and every photo
                    session, and unfortunately, some people decide to not show up to their scheduled appointment time.
                    The retainer fee will be refunded to you when you show up for your session. There is absolutely no
                    obligation to purchase anything or use this retainer fee towards purchases. </p><br>
